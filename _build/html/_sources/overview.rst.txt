Overview
========

These are my notes from the `series of videos by Lars Br√ºnjes <https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program>`_ for the Plutus Pioneers Program.

The source code for the lectures can be found `here <https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program/tree/main/code>`_.

These notes can be downloaded in PDF or ePub formats using the links at the bottom left of the page. Both formats are auto-generated and probably look ok, but I've
not yet spent any time making adjustments to work on any issues with their presentation.

To stay up-to-date with changes to these notes, you can follow me on Twitter @PoolChess.

.. note::
    The Plutus Pioneer lectures were created at a time when Plutus was going through rapid development. As a result, earlier lectures rely on earlier versions of the Plutus
    code. Once Plutus has settled into a stable form, I will update all these notes to reflect this, and will make sure to highlight the differences between the video 
    lectures and these written notes.
