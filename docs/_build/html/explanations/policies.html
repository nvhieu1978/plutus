<h2>Multi-Asset (MA) Support<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-asset-ma-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A blockchain, ledger, or cryptocurrency is said to have multi-asset (MA) support when the network or ledger supports tracking transfer and ownership of different types of assets on its ledger. In the Cardano environment, this functionality is provided by the Native Tokens feature.</p>
<p>This feature extends the existing accounting infrastructure defined in the ledger model, which is designed for processing ada-only transactions, to accommodate transactions that simultaneously use a range of assets. These assets include ada and a variety of user-define custom token types.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="native-vs-non-native-ma-support">
<h2>Native vs non-Native MA Support<a class="headerlink" href="#native-vs-non-native-ma-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some cryptocurrency ledgers have built-in support to track ownership and transfer of more than one type of asset. This type of MA support is called native. Cardano’s MA functionality is native.</p>
<p>If a cryptocurrency platform has sufficiently powerful smart contract functionality, it is possible to track assets for which there is no ledger accounting support. This is done with a layer-2 solution built using smart contracts. This type of MA support is non-native.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="principal-asset">
<h2>Principal Asset<a class="headerlink" href="#principal-asset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Assets on Cardano are all native, however, there is a sense in which ada is a special kind of asset. It is the only asset that, at this time, is accepted as fee-payment or to make deposits. It is also the only asset in which rewards are distributed. This property of ada (and no other type of asset) is due to the construction of the underlying consensus protocol. Because of this, on the Cardano platform, we refer to ada as the principal asset.</p>

<h2>Minting policy<a class="headerlink" href="#minting-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h3>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A minting policy is the set of rules that govern the minting and burning of assets scoped under that policy. The point of a minting policy is to specify the conditions under which tokens are minted (or burned). For example, the rules might specify who has control over the asset supply through minting and burning, for example.</p>
<p>Minting policies are defined by the users who want to create a new asset. For example, a user might wish to only allow themselves to mint any more of a certain kind of token. This would be specified in the policy.</p>
<p>Minting rules can be expressed :</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>As very basic set of rules that is made up of (ANDs and ORs of) :</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>a specification of what signatures are needed to allow the mint (i.e., a multisig specification, where no code is needed)</p></li>
<li><p>a specification of during what slot the script can be spent from (eg. after slot 15 and before slot 20)</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>With a Plutus Core script</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Adherence to minting policies is checked by the node at the time a transaction is processed, by running the code or checking the relevant signatures. Transactions must adhere to all the minting policies of all assets that the transaction is attempting to mint.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="important-points-about-minting-policies-and-assets-scoped-under-them">
<h3>Important points about minting policies and assets scoped under them.<a class="headerlink" href="#important-points-about-minting-policies-and-assets-scoped-under-them" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All assets necessarily have a minting policy. For example, the minting policy of ada is “new ada can never be minted”.</p></li>
<li><p>A token is associated with (i.e., scoped under) exactly one minting policy.</p></li>
<li><p>A single policy specifies both minting and burning conditions of tokens scoped under it. Adherence to it is checked both at the time of minting as well as burning.</p></li>
<li><p>An asset cannot ever change its associated minting policy. This association is permanent. In other words, existing tokens cannot be associated with a new policy. Users can, however, buy back and burn all existing tokens and mint new ones, with a new minting policy. Note that this is a feature, not a bug!</p></li>
<li><p>If an existing asset on the ledger is scoped under a particular policy, it is guaranteed that it was originally minted according to that policy.</p></li>
<li><p>Unless tokens of a given policy are being minted in a transaction, the actual policy is irrelevant. It is just used as an identifier of the asset.</p></li>
<li><p>Assets associated with different minting policies are never fungible with one another. They can be traded in the same way one may use USD to buy CAD: the amount of CAD you can buy with a fixed amount of USD depends on the exchange rate of the place where you do the trade.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="association-between-an-asset-and-its-minting-policy">
<h3>Association between an asset and its minting policy<a class="headerlink" href="#association-between-an-asset-and-its-minting-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The association between an asset and its minting policy is permanent for safety reasons: this feature protects the users and the system from illegitimately minted tokens.</p>
<p>If the minting policy of a token changes, it is not really the same token any more, and its value cannot be compared to that of the original token. This permanent asset-policy association scheme is integral to defining high-assurance policies. Loosening this identification opens our MA scheme to various attacks. Having a permanent association between these allows us to guarantee that every token was minted in accordance with its minting policy, and not any other policy which it might have previously been associated with.</p>
<p>Note that this is not as restrictive as it sounds. In a loose parallel with US monetary policy, we can say that the policy is “government and laws set the policy”, and this is a policy which requires looking up the current laws (which themselves could change), and only minting money in adherence to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="minting-policy-examples">
<h3>Minting policy examples<a class="headerlink" href="#minting-policy-examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Single-issuer policy</p></li>
<li><p>Time-locked mint policy</p></li>
<li><p>One-time mint policy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: There are many other types of minting policies.</p>
<p><strong>Single-issuer policy</strong></p>
<p>A single-issuer minting policy specifies that only the entity holding a particular set of keys is allowed to mint tokens of the particular asset group. For example, the set of keys specified in the minting policy must have signed the minting transaction.</p>
<p>An example of an asset group that would use a single-issuer policy would be tokens representing baseball cards. The company manufacturing legitimate collectors’ cards would publish the keys required by the minting script to mint new baseball cards. This would mean that no new baseball card tokens can be minted without the company’s signatures. This type of policy can be implemented without Plutus smart contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Time-locked mint policy (token-locking)</strong></p>
<p>This type of policy can be used to specify when tokens can be spent from an address. In particular,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>only in or after a specified time slot</p></li>
<li><p>only before a specified time slot</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This type of policy is usually not used by itself. Usually, it is in conjunction with the multisignature or single issuer policy, eg
This output can be spent after slot s and only by a transaction signed by key k</p>
<p>This type of policy can be implemented without Plutus smart contracts.</p>
<p><strong>One-time mint policy</strong></p>
<p>In a one-time mint policy, the complete set of tokens of a given asset group is minted by one specific transaction. This means that no more tokens in that particular  asset group will ever be minted. This type of policy needs Plutus smart contracts to be implemented.</p>
<p>One-type mint policies would be useful for generating concert ticket tokens for a specific concert, for example. The venue capacity is known ahead of time, so there’ll be no need to ever allow more tickets to be minted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="minting-transactions">
<h3>Minting transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#minting-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To introduce new quantities of new tokens on the ledger (minting) or to remove existing tokens (burning), each transaction features a mint field.The transactions where the mint field is not empty are known as minting transactions. The use of this field needs to be tightly controlled to ensure that the minting and burning of tokens occurs according to the token’s minting policy</p>
<p>Apart from the mint field, minting transactions must also carry the minting policies for the tokens they are minting, so that these tokens can be checked during validation.</p>
<p>The outcome of processing a minting transaction is that the ledger will contain the assets included in the mint field, which is included in the balancing of the transaction: if the field is positive, then the outputs of the transaction must contain more assets than the inputs provide; if it is negative then they must contain fewer.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight that a single transaction might mint tokens associated with multiple and distinct minting policies. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(Policy1,</span> <span class="pre">SomeTokens)</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(Policy2,</span> <span class="pre">SomeOtherTokens)</span></code>.
Also, a transaction might simultaneously mint some tokens and burn others.</p>
